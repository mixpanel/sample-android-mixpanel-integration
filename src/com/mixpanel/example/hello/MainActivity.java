     * - Log in to Mixpanel, and select the project you want to use for this application
     * - Click the gear icon in the lower left corner of the screen to view the settings dialog
     * - In the settings dialog, you will see the label "Token", and a string that looks something like this:
     *
     *        2ef3c08e8466df98e67ea0cfa1512e9f
     *
     *   Paste it below (where you see "YOUR API TOKEN")

     * In order for your app to receive push notifications, you will need to enable
     * the Google Cloud Messaging for Android service in your Google APIs console. To do this:
     *
     * - Navigate to https://code.google.com/apis/console
     * - Select "Services" from the menu on the left side of the screen
     * - Scroll down until you see the row labeled "Google Cloud Messaging for Android"
     * - Make sure the switch next to the service name says "On"
     *
     * To identify this application with your Google API account, you'll also need your sender id from Google.
     * You can get yours by logging in to the Google APIs Console at https://code.google.com/apis/console
     * Once you have logged in, your sender id will appear as part of the URL in your browser's address bar.
     * The URL will look something like this:
     *
     *     https://code.google.com/apis/console/b/0/#project:256660625236
     *                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^
     *
     * The twelve-digit number after 'project:' is your sender id. Paste it below (where you see "YOUR SENDER ID")
     *
     * There are also some changes you will need to make to your AndroidManifest.xml file to
     * declare the permissions and receiver capabilities you'll need to get your push notifications working.
     * You can take a look at this application's AndroidManifest.xml file for an example of what is needed.
